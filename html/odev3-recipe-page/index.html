            <h1><em>Instant Pot® Cheesecake</em></h1>
            <p><em>Cheesecake? In a pressure cooker? You bet. A creamy cheesecake relies on beating lots of air into the batter before cooking it. It also requires steaming. When you bake a cheesecake in the oven, you also need to put a pot of hot water underneath the springform pan to ensure the top of the cheesecake does not crack. In an Instant Pot®, all you need is a little water and the trivet. The result is a decadent cheesecake with no fuss. Serve with fruit on top, such as ripe blackberries.</em></p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h4>Crust:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>¾ cup crushed graham crackers</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Batter:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
                <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
                <li>2 eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li>⅔ cup sour cream</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pulse graham crackers, 2 teaspoons white sugar, and cinnamon in a food processor. Pour in melted butter; pulse until fine crumbs form. Pat the crust into the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of a 6-inch springform pan. Put the pan in the freezer for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Mix cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium-low speed until aerated and creamy, about 4 minutes. Add 2/3 cup sugar and salt; mix for 4 minutes more. Add vanilla extract and lemon zest; mix batter for 1 minute more.</li>
                <li>Crack 1 egg into the batter; mix for 1 minute. Add remaining egg; mix for 1 minute more. Stir in the sour cream; mix until it has disappeared into the batter, about 1 minute. Pour into the crust-lined pan. Make a loose tent over the pan with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Pour 1 1/2 cups of water into the bottom of the Instant Pot®; add the trivet. Lower the filled springform pan carefully into the Instant Pot®. Lock the lid into place.</li>
                <li>Choose the "Manual" setting; select high pressure. Set cook time for 40 minutes. When the timer goes off, allow pressure to naturally release for 18 minutes. Remove the lid. Check for doneness; edges should be set and the center should jiggle slightly when shaken.</li>
                <li>Transfer the cheesecake to the refrigerator. Chill for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
            </ol>
